V2022.30

    Implemented the font menu.
        This displays a new windows that lists all the fonts in the font directory.
        For a chosen font, it is checked that it is installed on the system - if not an error is displayed.
        If it is installed it is passed back to the main program and used for the current time.
        The new font is save at klock quit and used when re-run.
        A fonts directory has been added to the sub-project which includes a few selected fonts.
