    History files of sub project - pyDigitalKlock [Built with PySimpleGUI].
    Version numbers are taken from the main project.


V2022.33

    There was a problem with applying and saving transparency, should be save as a Boolean and not a string.
    The determining the font size never really worked, so stopped doing it.
        Instead I now change the window size to suit the font size.  I think this works better.
        The window size (width, height) has been added to the config file.


V2022.32

    There was a problem, in that when a new theme was applied the previous foreground and background
    colours where then applied.  The applying of a new theme should ignore previous foreground and
    background colours.  Applying a new theme now sets foreground and background colours to that of the theme.


V2022.31

    Implemented the theme menu.
        The displays a list of the installed themes available in a new window.
        If a them is selected a preview window is displayed.
        If a new theme is selected, this will over write any previous foreground & background colour choices.
    Amended config.py to return default values if it cant find the config key.
    Changed the window layout to use the no_titlebar option.
        Added the ability to move the window by dragging the mouse.


V2022.30

    Implemented the font menu.
        This displays a new windows that lists all the fonts in the font directory.
        For a chosen font, it is checked that it is installed on the system - if not an error is displayed.
        If it is installed it is passed back to the main program and used for the current time.
        The new font is save at klock quit and used when re-run.
        A fonts directory has been added to the sub-project which includes a few selected fonts.
