Klock will consist of a number of views, selected by a row of buttons along the bottom.

The first view is Fuzzy Time.
    The will display the current time in a number of different modes.
        i.e. in Words, in Hex, in Roman Numerals, in Binary etc.
    The font of the time can also be changed.


or will be [similar to lazKlock & klock.vb], at the moment a trying ground for ideas.
Stuff that I come across that might be useful.

Contains one sub project, pyDigitalKlock.
    This a simple app that tries to reproduce a LED Digital Klock.
    It allows the user to change the foreground and background colours.
    The background can also be switched to transparent.
    The font can also be selected from from a selection of fonts.
    It save the colours, font and app position between sessions.

One becomes two.
    the first pyDigitalKlock was built using pygubu, the second was built using pySimpleGui.
    The latter look better and more simple to use, maybe the way to go.
