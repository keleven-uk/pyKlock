V0222.23.9de0da2

    It looks like to install a font you need administer privileges on Windows - so abandon for now.
    When a list of fonts is presented for choice, they are checked to see if they are installed.
      if not installed they are coloured red and an error issues if chosen.


V2022.22.5cd4165

    Now returns a valid font, all seems to be working.
    The current font [name and size] is saved between sessions.
    Added font name and size to config file [both config.py & config.toml].
    Added font path to projectPaths.py
    in pyDigitalKlock.py, current time takes its initial font from config
      and will change when a new font is selected from the menu's.


V2022.21.9cf9169

    Added a new menu - Fonts.
      This displays a new dialog which lists all the fonts in the font directory - src\Fonts.py
          The font file name has to be the same as the font family name.
      Also, added module src\utils\font_utils.py which contains common font related functions.
    Modifications to pyDigitalKlock.py to call Font menu etc.
      Moved function check_font to font_utils.py

    Currently not returning a valid font object from font form - work to do.


V2022.20.cf917da

    Changes so that auto-py-to-ese [pyinstaller] would work.
        Main changes to projectPaths, comfig.tmol and log files now live
        in same directory as the executable.


V2022.19.93ceb1c

    Now working against Python V3.10.4git commit

    Added extra properties to config.py & config.toml.
        Added FOREGROUND, BACKGROUND, TRANSPARENT, X_POS & YPOS.
        These properties have both setters and getters.
    Added the ability to save the current stats of the config settings.
    Now when the app quits, it save the current setting, so position, colours
        and transparency are seven between sessions.


V202.18.3d4f978

    Added the ability to choose the colour of both foreground and background.
        Added menu option which load colour chooser for both foreground and background.
        Added logic to set the colour for both foreground and background
    Added the ability to have the background transparent.
        Added both menu and logic to achieve transparency.
    Removed the top level header i.e. title, close and minimise icons.
        Added logic to move the app via the mouse, using left click to drag.
    Set meu accelerator to quit menu - can now close app with <Control-q>.


V2022.17.93ccf3e

    Created an about dialog - in src\about.py.
        Amended menus to call new about dialog.
    Created src\projectPaths to hold relevant paths used throw-out the project.


V2022.16.1d7e07d

    Started build of the menus.
        Added File/Quit & File/Help.
        Implemented simple action for each.


V2022.15.a879173

    Added to src - config.py, License.py & Logger.py
    Amended to use config and logger files.


V2022.14.9ed795a

	Simplified the status bar formatting.
           This was achieved by using three labels - date, state & idle time.


V2022.13.3643d9a

    Added directory - bin - holds any executables.
    Added directory - src - holds the main source code files.
    Added directory - src\utils - holds any utility source code files [both .py and .ui].
    Added main.py to top level directory, which is used to start the L.E.D. Klock.
    Tried to format the status bar label, a bit klunky.
        There is a formatStatus routine in pyDigitalKlock_utils.py.
        This attempts to space out the three strings using guess work.


V2022.12.71f7527

    Added a sub project - pyDigitalKlock.
    An attempt to re-create a LCD Klock.
    The gui is built using pygubu-designer.
    Basically a couple of labels.
    The main label shows the current time using a digital font.
    The second label, acting as a status bar, shows the date, the state of the lock
    keys [caps, scroll & num] and the PC idles time.
