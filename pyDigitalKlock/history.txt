    The current font [name and size] is saved between sessions.
    Added font name and size to config file [both config.py & config.toml].

    in pyDigitalKlock.py, current time takes its initial font from config
      and will change when a new font is selected from the menu's.


V2022.21

    Added a new menu - Fonts.
      This displays a new form which list all the fonts in the font directory - src\Fonts.py
          The font file name has to be the same as the font family name.
      Also, added module src\utils\font_utils.py which contains common font related functions.
    Modifications to pyDigitalKlock.py to call Font menu etc.

V2022.14.9ed795a

	Simplified the status bar formatting.
           This was achieved by using three labels - date, state & idle time.


V2022.13.3643d9a

    Added directory - bin - holds any executables.
    Added directory - src - holds the main source code files.
    Added directory - src\utils - holds any utility source code files [both .py and .ui].
    Added main.py to top level directory, which is used to start the L.E.D. Klock.
    Tried to format the status bar label, a bit klunky.
        There is a formatStatus routine in pyDigitalKlock_utils.py.
        This attempts to space out the three strings using guess work.


V2022.12.71f7527

    Added a sub project - pyDigitalKlock.
    An attempt to re-create a LCD Klock.
    The gui is built using pygubu-designer.
    Basically a couple of labels.
    The main label shows the current time using a digital font.
    The second label, acting as a status bar, shows the date, the state of the lock
    keys [caps, scroll & num] and the PC idles time.
