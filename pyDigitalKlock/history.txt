    History files of sub project - pyDigitalKlock.
    Version numbers are taken from the main project.


V2022.16

    [pyDigitalKlock]
        Started build of the menus.
            Added File/Quit & File/Help.
            Implemented simple action for each.

V2022.15

    [pyKlock]
        Added fonts directory, added fonts DS-DIGI & Pixel LCD-7

    [pyDigitalKlock]
        Added to src - config.py, License.py & Logger.py
        Amended to use config and logger files.


V2022.14

    [pyKlock]
        Moved requirements.txt to requirements\product.txt
        Moved requirements_dev to requirements\development.txt

    [pyDigitalKlock]
	Simplified the status bar formatting.
           This was achieved by using three labels - date, state & idle time.


V2022.13

    Added directory - bin - holds any executables.
    Added directory - src - holds the main source code files.
    Added directory - src\utils - holds any utility source code files [both .py and .ui].
    Added main.py to top level directory, which is used to start the L.E.D. Klock.
    Tried to format the status bar label, a bit klunky.
        There is a formatStatus routine in pyDigitalKlock_utils.py.
        This attempts to space out the three strings using guess work.


V2022.12

    Added a sub project - pyDigitalKlock.
    An attempt to re-create a LCD Klock.
    The gui is built using pygubu-designer.
    Basically a couple of labels.
    The main label shows the current time using a digital font.
    The second label, acting as a status bar, shows the date, the state of the lock
    keys [caps, scroll & num] and the PC idles time.
