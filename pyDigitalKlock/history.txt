V2022.12

    Added a sub project - pyDigitalKlock.
    An attempt to re-create a LCD Klock.
    The gui is built using pygubu-designer.
    Basically a couple of labels.
    The main label shows the current time using a digital font.
    The second label, acting as a status bar, shows the date, the state of the lock
    keys [caps, scroll & num] and the PC idles time.
