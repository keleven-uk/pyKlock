    History files of sub project - pyDigitalKlock.
    Version numbers are taken from the main project.

V2022.13

    Added directory - bin - holds ant executables
    Added directory - src - holds the main source code files.
    Added directory - src\utils - holds any utility source code files [both .py and .ui].
    Added main.py to top level directory, which is used to start the L.E.D. Klock.
    Tried to format the status bar label, a bit klunky.
        There is a formatStaus routine in pyDigitalKlock_utils.py.
        This attempts to space out the three strings using guess work.


V2022.12

    Added a sub project - pyDigitalKlock.
    An attempt to re-create a LCD Klock.
    The gui is built using pygubu-designer.
    Basically a couple of labels.
    The main label shows the current time using a digital font.
    The second label, acting as a status bar, shows the date, the state of the lock
    keys [caps, scroll & num] and the PC idles time.
