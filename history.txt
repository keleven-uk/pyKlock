    [pyKlock]
        Moved requirements.txt to requirements\product.txt
        Moved requirements_dev to requirements\development.txt

    [pyDigitalKlock]
	Simplified the status bar formatting.
           This was achieved by using three labels - date, state & idle time.


V2022.13

    [pyDigitalKlock]
    	Added directory - bin - holds any executables.
    	Added directory - src - holds the main source code files.
    	Added directory - src\utils - holds any utility source code files [both .py and .ui].
    	Added main.py to top level directory, which is used to start the L.E.D. Klock.
    	Tried to format the status bar label, a bit klunky.
        	There is a formatStatus routine in pyDigitalKlock_utils.py.
        	This attempts to space out the three strings using guess work.


V2022.12

    [pyDigitalKlock]
    	Added a sub project - pyDigitalKlock.
    	An attempt to re-create a LCD Klock.
    	The gui is built using pygubu-designer.
    	Basically a couple of labels.
    	The main label shows the current time using a digital font.
    	The second label, acting as a status bar, shows the date, the state of the lock
    	keys [caps, scroll & num] and the PC idles time.
