   History file of the main project - pyKlock
   All entries to main project - unless stated.
   Main project to be initially built using pySimpleGUI

   Contains a sub-projects in two parts.
     pyDigitalKlock - An attempt to re-create a LCD Klock.
       pyDigitalKlock.pygubu - built with pygubu.
       pyDigitalKlock.psg    - built with pySimpleGUI


V2022.35

    Added skeleton window layouts for Fuzzy Time, World Klock, Countdown & timer.
        These live in src\layouts.git add .
    The main klock windows loads with Fuzzy Time and allows the other faces to be selected
    using buttons.  The button will display the selected layout, overwriting the previous one.
    Start of the menu system consisting of File|Exit & Help|Licence|About.
        The License and About display simple info windows.


V2022.34

    Laid out the basic directory structure of the main project - pyKlock.
    Copied python files from sub projects that will be re-used [modified] in the main project.


V2022.33

[pyDigitalKlock.psg]
    There was a problem with applying and saving transparency, should be save as a Boolean and not a string.
    The determining the font size never really worked, so stopped doing it.
        Instead I now change the window size to suit the font size.  I think this works better.
        The window size (width, height) has been added to the config file.


V2022.32

[pyDigitalKlock.psg]
    There was a problem, in that when a new theme was applied the previous foreground and background
    colours where then applied.  The applying of a new theme should ignore previous foreground and
    background colours.  Applying a new theme now sets foreground and background colours to that of the theme.


V2022.31

[pyDigitalKlock.psg]
    Implemented the theme menu.
        The displays a list of the installed themes available in a new window.
        If a them is selected a preview window is displayed.
        If a new theme is selected, this will over write any previous foreground & background colour choices.
    Amended config.py to return default values if it cant find the config key.
    Changed the window layout to use the no_titlebar option.
        Added the ability to move the window by dragging the mouse.


The two versions [pySimpleGUI & pygubu] and now both virtually at the same point.
The pySimpleGUI version is about 350 lines of code smaller - mainly .ui file.
Although pySimpleGui doesn't have the same refinement of layout, it is a lot
more simpler to use.  Also, seems to have a lot more features.

V2022.30

[pyDigitalKlock.psg]
    Implemented the font menu.
        This displays a new windows that lists all the fonts in the font directory.
        For a chosen font, it is checked that it is installed on the system - if not an error is displayed.
        If it is installed it is passed back to the main program and used for the current time.
        The new font is save at klock quit and used when re-run.
        A fonts directory has been added to the sub-project which includes a few selected fonts.

V0222.23

[pyDigitalKlock.pygubu]
    It looks like to install a font you need administer privileges on Windows - so abandon for now.
