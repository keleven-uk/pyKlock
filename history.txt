   History file of the main project - pyKlock
   All entries to main project - unless stated.
   Main project to be initially built using pySimpleGUI

   Contains a sub-projects in two parts.
     pyDigitalKlock - An attempt to re-create a LCD Klock.
       pyDigitalKlock_pygubu - built with pygubu.
       pyDigitalKlock_psg    - built with pySimpleGUI


V2022.51

    Added the delete button for the reminder view, this also uses the add form.
        When a reminder is deleted, all the remaining reminders are re numbered.


V2022.50

    Added the edit button for the reminder view, this uses an amended add form.
        The add form now takes two extra arguments - mode & line no.
        If the mode is "EDIT" then this allows the reminder at row line no the be edited.
        Added two ne methods to the reminders class - save & get reminder.
    Also, may have solved the table size problem.


V2022.49

    Amended the add form, so that the event type is a drop down list.
        The list is populated form a text file which resides in the data directory.
    Changed the list box on the main reminder view to a table.
        This allows for proper column headers.
        Needs some work on getting the correct size.
    Reminders can now be added and saved.  They are correctly viewed in the reminder table.
        The reminder tabled is correctly populated whenever the reminder view is selected.


V2022.48 form

    Implementing the Reminder view, not complete yet.
    Finished the main view that will display the reminders, with buttons to add and remove reminders.
    Finished the add window, which is a separate window that open when the add button is selected.
        The reminders will be stored in a database using the python pickles on a shelve.
        The basics of this has been implemented.
    Changed the order of some of the code in the event loop.
        This was so the "EXIT" could be in the match statement.


V2022.47.9506dca

    Corrected the multiple windows bug in pyDigitalKlock_psg.


V2022.46.0fe08f3

    Created a bin directory to hole the pyInstaller created executable of pyKlock.
        Used auto-py-to-exe as the fron end, the settings file is bin\pyKlock.json.
        pyInstaller didn't like some of the path, changed to raw strings.
    There was a bug in re-creating the window when ever the font, theme or time type was changed.
        This resulting in more then on window existing.  This was because I used to
        disappear the window, create a new one and then appear the original.
        I now close the first window before creating the second.


V2022.45.4ef0ac5

    Added the local time to the title bar.
    Amended some references pyDigitalKlock to pyKlock in src/config.py
    Removed some debugging lines.
    Updated README.md


V2022.44.71aa87e

    Implemented the World Klock view.
    A new file pyklock\src\world_klock.py holds the world_klock class.
    This displays the time in a given time zone, that is selected from a drop down list.
    Added two files to the requirements directory - development_pyklock & product_pyklock


V2022.43.88a5097

    Added actions to the countdown, choices are selected from a combo box.
        Choices are "None", "Notify", "Notify + Sound", "Pop Up", "Shutdown PC", "Log Out PC".
        More actions will be added when needed.


V2022.42,895f4e5

    Amended the countdown class, so that a copy of the window object is passed in.
    This allows countdown to raise an event when finished that can be read in the main event loop.
    When countdown finishes a notification is generated and a .mp3 file is played.
    Problem with playing mp3 files, will only play until the next read in the event loop.
        It does seem like that, work around is that it play as long as the notification is visible.
    Only the required buttons are now visible, all redundant buttons are hidden.
    Removed button_color=sg.TRANSPARENT_BUTTON from all buttons - look better now.


V2022.41.fe755ca
    Implemented the countdown view.
    A new file pyklock\src\countdown.py holds the countdown class.
    This allows a time interval to be set, either via a spin control or pre-set buttons,
        and the time will count down to zero.
    The buttons all have icons and tooltips.
        the start and stop icons are same as the stopwatch.
    The form title now reflects the current view, if the countdown is running then the
        countdown value is included in the title.
    Added two new fonts DIXIE & Harry P.


V2022.40.cc2fd4f

    Implemented the stopwatch view.
    A new file pyklock\src\stopwatch.py holds the stopwatch class.
    This consists a clock face to display hours, minutes and seconds and a row of buttons.
    The buttons allow for the timer to be started, stopped, resumed, paused and cleared.
    The buttons all have icons and tooltips.
        The icon files reside in pyklock\resources.
    The form title now reflects the current view, if the stopwatch is running then the
        stopwatch value is included in the title.

V2022.39.c68ed15

    Theme & Font now reside in the settings menu.
    Used sg.VPush to centre Fuzzy Time text & Time Types combo box.
    Always had the problem with font size, when the font is changed.
        For each time type, measure the longest text possible and use to try and determine
        the appropriate font size, this is then used to set the font.
        This is done in src\utils\fonts_utils\set_font()
        So, when a new time type is chosen the window is re-created with the new font size.
    Added fonts Nancy Blackett semaphore and backwards.


V2022.38.130fed1

    Implemented the font menu.
        Because installing font needs administrator privileges and trkinter has not have a  font dialog.
        The font menu option will load a form that displays all the fonts in the font sub directory of pyKlock.
        A font can be selected, and if installed on the system, will be applied to the time text.
        If the font is not installed, an error message is displayed.
    Added time type to config.py & config.toml.
    Also save the window size and location in config.toml, only location is used at the moment.


V2022.37.1c928b2

    Added two new menu options - Font to the File menu, not implemented yet.
    Also, A new menu option Time.  The first option is LCD Klock.
        This loads the sub project pyDigitalKlock_psg.
        pyDigitalKlock_psg is loaded from the python source using sg.execute_py_file()


V2022.36.3144b47

    Update of pyKlock status bar now work okay, date, key status & idle time.
    Fuzzy Time now works, this now display the current time in many different formats.
        i.e. in words, fuzzy time, in hex, in roman numerals, in binary etc.
        The format of the time is chosen from a drop down menu [combo box].
    The window size and location is now specifies in config and save at the end of the session.
        These are passed to the klock layout when the window is created.


V2022.35.e660ea2

    The separate layouts in separate modules created a problem.
        Implemented the trick in re-creating the window to apply a change in theme.
        The worked in pgDigitalKlock but not in pyKlock, this was traced to the layout modules.
        If the individual layouts are all in one module, the theme change works, if not an error.


V2022.34.ee8175c

    Added skeleton window layouts for Fuzzy Time, World Klock, Countdown & timer.
        These live in src\layouts.git add .
    The main klock windows loads with Fuzzy Time and allows the other faces to be selected
    using buttons.  The button will display the selected layout, overwriting the previous one.
    Start of the menu system consisting of File|Exit & Help|Licence|About.
        The License and About display simple info windows.


V2022.33.37f936c

    Laid out the basic directory structure of the main project - pyKlock.
    Copied python files from sub projects that will be re-used [modified] in the main project.


V2022.32.9be69de

[pyDigitalKlock.psg]
    There was a problem with applying and saving transparency, should be save as a Boolean and not a string.
    The determining the font size never really worked, so stopped doing it.
        Instead I now change the window size to suit the font size.  I think this works better.
        The window size (width, height) has been added to the config file.


V2022.31.6547308

[pyDigitalKlock.psg]
    There was a problem, in that when a new theme was applied the previous foreground and background
    colours where then applied.  The applying of a new theme should ignore previous foreground and
    background colours.  Applying a new theme now sets foreground and background colours to that of the theme.
    Implemented the theme menu.
        The displays a list of the installed themes available in a new window.
        If a them is selected a preview window is displayed.
        If a new theme is selected, this will over write any previous foreground & background colour choices.
    Amended config.py to return default values if it cant find the config key.
    Changed the window layout to use the no_titlebar option.
        Added the ability to move the window by dragging the mouse.


The two versions [pySimpleGUI & pygubu] and now both virtually at the same point.
The pySimpleGUI version is about 350 lines of code smaller - mainly .ui file.
Although pySimpleGui doesn't have the same refinement of layout, it is a lot
more simpler to use.  Also, seems to have a lot more features.


V2022.30.38961ce

[pyDigitalKlock.psg]
    Implemented the font menu.
        This displays a new windows that lists all the fonts in the font directory.
        For a chosen font, it is checked that it is installed on the system - if not an error is displayed.
        If it is installed it is passed back to the main program and used for the current time.
        The new font is save at klock quit and used when re-run.
        A fonts directory has been added to the sub-project which includes a few selected fonts.
