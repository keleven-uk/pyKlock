V0222.23

[pyDigitalKlock.pygubu]
    It looks like to install a font you need administer privileges on Windows - so abandon for now.
    When a list of fonts is presented for choice, they are checked to see if they are installed.
      if not installed they are coloured red and an error issues if chosen.

    The current font [name and size] is saved between sessions.
    Added font name and size to config file [both config.py & config.toml].
    Added font path to projectPaths.py
    in pyDigitalKlock.py, current time takes its initial font from config
      and will change when a new font is selected from the menu's.

[pyKlock]
    font directy currently consists of DS-Digital, Pixel LCD7, itlivesintheswamp & Twobit
